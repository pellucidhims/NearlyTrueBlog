## Challanges and hacks applied

`Note:` Fetch by category is non-functioning as API to fetch posts by category couldn't be located in short time. 
 However, it's same in functionality as that of fetch by 'tags' which is working.

 `Note:` On Codesandbox, API to get related posts was throwing error 405(Method not allowed) so the related posts are dummy fetched via PostMan.
 Same would work once the dummy data is replaced with API data after uncommenting respective function in the ApiFunctionCalls component.
